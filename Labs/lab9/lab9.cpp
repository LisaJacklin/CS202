#include <iostream>

/*
Requirements:
1. implement a complex number class named complex.
 - separate into complex.cpp and complex.hpp
 2.implement:
 - constructor that takes two doubles, real and complex.
 - constructor that takes one parameter setting real part.
    - note provide a default value of zero for second parameter.
3. implement stream insertion operator (for complex numb)
4. implement + operator for complex numbers.
5. implement += for complex numbers. 
6. implement one in terms of the other (using 4 and 5)
7. write main.cpp demonstrating operators defined.
- code to use:
cout << 1+Complex (2,3) << endl;
8. for this to work, you must make the right choice of global or 
member function for operator +;
